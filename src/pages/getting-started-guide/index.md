In order to get started with the website you first need to install and get everything ready.

Let's start by installing the necessary tools:

**1.** Download and install Node.js (latest stable version) from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

**2.** Open a PowerShell terminal as an administrator and run the following command: `npm i -g angular@cli`.

**3.** Download or clone the [website codebase](https://github.com/ChrisDoykov/hubcap).

Once installed open up your code editor of choice and open a new terminal.

**4.** In that terminal, while in the hubcap folder, run `npm i` to install all dependencies.

**5.** Once npm has finished running if there are no issues you can run `ng serve` to open up the website locally (takes about a minute on first load).

**6.** If there have been issues and the server doesn't want to run try running the `npm audit fix` command in the terminal to fix any dependency issues, if still not wokring - [contact me](mailto:b7078041@ncl.ac.uk).
